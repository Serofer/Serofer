### Hi there 👋
I'm very new on github and I'm very inexperienced in coding and project development. 😁

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a website for the Swiss Army to help the new members to have an easier start. Additionally, I'll start a security camera project using my Raspberry Pi 4 and the Object Detection Model from YoloV5.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with Frid0l1n and Krypton.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Open Source
- 📚 Life Long Learner
